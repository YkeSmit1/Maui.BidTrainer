*******************************************

** control bidding **

If you do a controlbid, it means the opponents cannot immediately cash two tricks in the bid suit. So you have Ace, King or singleton or void

If you skip a suit, you deny a control in this suit

If you know a control is missing, you bid the trump suit

A bid is a control bid if you already have a fit
But also if it is a strange jump which cannot mean something else


** RKC (Aces) **

There are five keycards, the king of trumps also counts

RKC is always with 4NT, but a trump suit has to be set

Responses
5♣           1 or 4 keycards
5♦     0 or 3 keycards
5♥     2 or 5 keycards, no trump queen
5♠           2 or 5 keycards with trump queen

After a response which doesn’t tell anything about the trump queen, you can ask with the next bid which is not the trumpsuit for the trump queen

After a trump queen ask, the trumpsuit denies the trump queen amd something else shows the trump queen and a King in the bid suit
