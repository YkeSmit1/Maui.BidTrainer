** Negative double **

Double shows a fourcard in the unbid major and 6+ points
If you bid a new suit, it shows a five card
If there is no unbid major, double shows both minors

Reverse bidding means bidding a new suit higher than two in your own suit
 
Example : 1♣ 1♠ 2♥ 
Reverse shows 16+ points and it is forcing
